"""Exercise the post-turn quality stop hook end to end and in pieces.

This module covers the hook's expected git-state decisions, environment
parsing, subprocess error handling, make-target discovery, and compush
follow-up behavior. The tests focus on observable inputs and outputs,
including successful checks, soft-failure paths that must stay silent,
and blocking/error conditions that should surface through the hook
contract.

Run the suite from the repository root with `pytest` or the repository's
test target. No external fixtures or environment setup are required
beyond a Python environment with `pytest` installed because the tests
mock subprocess-heavy interactions.

Example:
    python3 -m pytest tests/test_hook.py -v
